Test functions by deploying again or interacting with deployed contract.

On successful Deployment, we wil get multiple functions in Remix ide 
check
total supply = 15 * 10**18,
owner = deployer address.

To test use case we will use three main functions:

deposit = deposits the input amount in the slab 5 by default if slab is not full. (max = 500)
totalDeposit  = It gives the total tokens present in the slabs.
getTokenSlab = get slabs in which you tokens are present by just providing your address.
